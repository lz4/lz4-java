<p>LZ4 compression. The entry point of the API is the
{@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Factory} class, which gives access to
{@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4Compressor compressors} and
{@link net.jpountz.lz4.LZ4SafeDecompressor decompressors}.</p>


<p>Sample usage:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
    LZ4Factory factory = LZ4Factory.fastestInstance();

    byte[] data = "12345345234572".getBytes("UTF-8");
    final int decompressedLength = data.length;

    // compress data
    LZ4Compressor compressor = factory.fastCompressor();
    int maxCompressedLength = compressor.maxCompressedLength(decompressedLength);
    byte[] compressed = new byte[maxCompressedLength];
    int compressedLength = compressor.compress(data, 0, decompressedLength, compressed, 0, maxCompressedLength);

    // decompress data
    // - method 1: when the decompressed length is known
    LZ4FastDecompressor decompressor = factory.fastDecompressor();
    byte[] restored = new byte[decompressedLength];
    int compressedLength2 = decompressor.decompress(compressed, 0, restored, 0, decompressedLength);
    // compressedLength == compressedLength2

    // - method 2: when the compressed length is known (a little slower)
    // the destination buffer needs to be over-sized
    LZ4SafeDecompressor decompressor2 = factory.safeDecompressor();
    int decompressedLength2 = decompressor2.decompress(compressed, 0, compressedLength, restored, 0);
    // decompressedLength == decompressedLength2
</pre>
